## **nn**
Implementation of (some of my favorite) Neural Networks in Python. <br>
The repository contains the implementation of popular and commonly used neural networks in the domain of deep learning. <br>
These neural networks are implemented using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) libraries which are widely used. <br>
